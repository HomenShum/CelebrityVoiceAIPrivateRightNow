He knew that he had the power in the relationship and he used it to get what he wanted from Mary.\\n\\nAnother power dynamic that affected their interactions was the difference in their social status.

He was able to use his family's resources to get what he wanted, while Mary had to rely on her own resources.\\n\\nThis power dynamic affected their interactions in a few different ways.

He was always aware of his higher social status and he used it to get what he wanted from Mary.\\n\\nThe final power dynamic that affected their interactions was the difference in their age. John was significantly older than Mary. This meant that he had more life experience and he was more mature than Mary.\\n\\nThis power dynamic affected their interactions in a few different ways.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Changed for six cigarettes, often weeks later, although they what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I became the proud owner of a what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Arettes could be exchanged for twelve soups, and twelve what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were soups often a very real respite from starvation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The privilege of actually smoking cigarettes was reserved for whom?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the capo, who had his assured quota of weekly coupons, what was next?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or possibly for a prisoner who worked as a foreman in a prison?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Warehouse or workshop and received a few cigarettes in?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In his strength to carry on, and, once lost, the will to live?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When one examines the vast amount of material, what does one find?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Has been amassed as the result of many prisoners' observations?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are three phases of the inmate's mental?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reactions to camp life become apparent: the period follow-up?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the period when he is well entrenched in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the camp routine and what was the period following his release?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the symptom that characterizes the first phase?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Under certain conditions, may shock even precede the pris?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whose formal admission to the camp is it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I shall give as an example?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you please elaborate on the circumstances of your own admission?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How long had fifteen hundred persons been traveling by train?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How many people were in each group?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All had to lie on top of their luggage, the few remaining chairs being saved for the sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did all have to lie on top of their luggage, the few remaining chairs being saved for the sick?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were only the top parts of the windows free to let?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For which munitions factory would we be employed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We did not know whether we were?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still in Silesia or already in Poland?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the sound have an uncanny quality, like a cry for help sent out in desperation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the load's destiny?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does the sign say?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone's heart missed a beat at that moment. What happened?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Auschwitzâ€”the very name stood for all that was horrible:?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gas chambers, crematoriums, massacres--what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tatingly, the train moved on as if it wanted to spare its passengers the trouble of having to disembark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did the train do as if it wanted to spare its passengers the trouble of having to disembark?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Passengers, the dreadful realization as long as possible:?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the progressive dawn, what are the outlines of an immense?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Camp became visible: long stretches of several rows of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are barbed wire fences, watch towers, search lights, and long?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Columns of ragged human figures, grey in the greyness of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dawn, trekking along the straight desolate roads, to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We did not know their meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My imagination led me to see gallows with people dangling?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was horrified, but this was just as well, because why?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Step by step, did we have to become accustomed to a terrible and?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eventually we moved into the station?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those rough, shrill tones from then on, over and over again?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their sound was almost like the last cry of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A victim, and yet there was a difference?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hoarseness, as if it came from the throat of a man who had what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To keep shouting like that, is a man who was being murdered?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The carriage doors were flung open and a what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Small detachment of prisoners stormed inside what?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you control your feelings even in the most desperate situation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What do these prisoners look like?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, don't they seem to be in good spirits and even laugh?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could I manage to share their favorable position?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In psychiatry, is there a certain condition known as \"delusion?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Does his execution give him the illusion that he might be reprieved?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we, too, cling to shreds of hope?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And do you believe to the last moment that it would not be so?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just the sight of the red cheeks and round faces of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 24 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were those prisoners a great encouragement?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who formed a specially chosen elite?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For years, had the receiving squad been the new transports?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They rolled into the station day after day.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What happened to the new arrivals and their luggage, including scarce items?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the spot in Europe during the last years of the war?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have been unique treasures of gold and silver, platinum?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And diamonds, not only in the huge storehouses but also in where?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fifteen hundred captives were cooped up in a shed built?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How many people can be accommodated at the most?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were you cold and hungry, and was there not enough room for you?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone to squat on the bare ground, let alone to lie down?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One five-ounce piece of bread was our only food in four days?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet did I hear the senior prisoners in charge of the shed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bargain with one member of the receiving party about what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the tie-pin made of?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would eventually be traded for liquorâ€”schnapps?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do you remember how many thousands of marks there were?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were needed to purchase the quantity of schnapps required?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a \"gay evening,\" but i do know that those long-term?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could you blame them for trying to dope themselves?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another group of prisoners who got liquor supplied in al\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most unlimited quantities by the ss: these were the men?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who were employed in the gas chambers and crematoriums?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And who knew very well that one day they would be re\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did they believe that they would have to by a new shift of men?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leave their enforced role of executioner and become victims?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nearly everyone in our transport lived under the illusion that they would be able to return home soon.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That he would be reprieved, that everything would yet be?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we not realize the meaning behind the scene?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were we told to leave our luggage?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the train and to fall into two linesâ€”women on one side, men on the otherâ€”and to go up the stairs?'\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Menâ€”on the other, in order to file past a senior SS officer?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Surprisingly enough, did I have the courage to hide my haver?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My line filed past the officer, man by man?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I realized that it would be dangerous if the officer?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He would at least knock me down; i knew?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would he at least knock me down; i knew?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On approaching the officer, did you do so that he would not notice?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then i was face to face with him?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who was the tall man who looked slim and fit in his spotless uniform?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What a contrast to us, who were untidy and grimy after our work in the fields?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did he assume an attitude of careless ease?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Supporting his right elbow with his left hand, what does he do next?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hand was lifted, and with the forefinger of that hand he what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pointed very leisurely to the right or to the left?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you have the slightest idea of the sinister meaning behind that?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the little movement of a man's finger pointing to the right?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And now to the left, but far more frequently to the left.?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somebody whispered to me, \"To be?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sent to the right side would mean work, the way to the left?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who would being for the sick and those incapable of work?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is that where you want to be sent?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I just waited for things to take what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their course, the first of many such times to come?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sack weighed me down a bit to the left, but i made an effort?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the sack weigh you down a bit to the left, but you made an effort?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The SS man looked me over, appeared to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Should he hesitate, then put both his hands on my shoulders?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it very hard to look smart, and did he turn your shoulders very?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly until i faced right, and i moved over to that side.?'\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the significance of the finger game?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was the first selection, the first verdict?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the meaning of life?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did the majority of our transport being about 90 per cent mean?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their sentence was carried out within the next few hours?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those who were sent to the left were marched from the where?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 26 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the word \"bath\" have been told by someone who worked there?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does the sentence say written over the doors in several European languages?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Entering, each prisoner was handed a piece of soap, and what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But mercifully, do I not need to describe the events?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We who were saved, the minority of our transport, found what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the truth?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had been there for some time where my colleague and I?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was he sent to the left side?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Yes,\" I replied?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Then you can see him there,\" I was told.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hand pointed to the chimney a few hundred what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yards off, which was sending a column of flame up into the sky?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It dissolved into a sinister cloud of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"That's where your friend is, floating up to heaven,\" was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I still did not understand until the truth?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was I explained to in plain words?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But am I telling things out of their turn?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Logical point of view, did we have a long, long way in front of us?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the break of that dawn at the station until our first what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the night's rest at the camp?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Escorted by ss guards with loaded guns, were we made to?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Run from the station, past electrically charged barbed wire,?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through the camp, to the cleansing station; for those of us?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who had passed the first selection? This was a real bath.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Again our illusion of reprieve found confirmation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were they nice to us as long as they saw watches on?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our wrists and could persuade us in well-meaning tones to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would we not have to hand over all of our belongings?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Possessions anyway, and why should not that relatively nice?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe one day he would do one a favor?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We waited in a shed which seemed to be the anteroom to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did we have to throw all our possessions into?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Among us who asked, to the amusement of the more sea-going, was a landlubber who had never been on a boat before\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could not the ones who were there as helpers do anything?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Keep a wedding ring, a medal or a good-luck piece?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could you yet grasp the fact that everything would be taken?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I tried to take one of the old prisoners into my confidence, but he just stared at me blankly.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Approaching him furtively, i pointed to the roll of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Paper in the inner pocket of my coat and said, \"look, this?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the manuscript of a scientific book?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Say that I should be grateful to escape with my life, that?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That should be all I can expect of fate?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I must keep this manuscript at all costs; it contains what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was he beginning to understand?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly over his face, first piteous, then more amused, mockingly, the knowledge came that they two were doomed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly over his face, first piteous, then more amused, mockingly, the knowledge came that they two were doomed. Did the knowledge that they two were doomed come slowly over his face, first piteous, then more amused, mockingly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did he bellow at me in answer?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To my question, a word that was ever present in the vocabu\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lary of the camp inmates: \"shit!\"?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What marked the culminating point of plain truth and did?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first phase of my psychological reaction: i struck out my?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suddenly there was a stir among my fellow travelers, who?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had been standing about with pale, frightened faces, help?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Again we heard the hoarsely shouted com\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were we driven with blows into the immediate?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who waited until we had all arrived?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will you give me two minutes and time me by your watch?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In these two minutes, will you get fully undressed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And drop everything on the floor where you are standing?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will you take nothing with you except your shoes and your belt?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or suspenders, and possibly a truss?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With unthinkable haste, people tore off their clothes.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The time grew shorter, did they become increasingly nervous?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And pulled clumsily at their underwear, belts and shoes?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then we heard the first sounds of whipping; leather?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the straps beating down on naked bodies?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next we were herded into another room to be shaved?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not only our heads were shorn, but not a hair was left on?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then on to the showers, where did we line up?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We hardly recognized each other; but with great what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did relief some people noted that real water dripped from the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While we were waiting for the shower, our nakedness was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Brought home to us: we really had nothing now except our what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bare bodiesâ€”even minus hair; all we possessed, literally,?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What else remained for us as a?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Material link with our former lives?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did I have to exchange later on?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was there an extra bit of excitement?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is in store for the owners of trusses?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prisoner in charge of our hut welcomed us with a speech in what language?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which he gave us his word of honor that he would hang?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Personally, \"from that beam\"--he pointed to it--any person could have fallen?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Son, who had sewn money or precious stones into his truss, what were you thinking?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Proudly he explained that as a senior inhabitant of the camp?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are laws entitled him to do so?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where were our shoes not so?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although we were supposed to keep them, those what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who had to give up their fairly decent pairs?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And were given in exchange shoes that did not fit?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What were the real troubles for those prisoners who had followed the ap?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the well-meant advice given in the anteroom?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Senior prisoners and had shortened their jackboots by cut\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ting the tops off, then smearing soap on the cut edges to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ss men seemed to have waited for what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All suspected of this crime had to go into a small room?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a time, did we again hear the lashings?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the strap, and the screams of tortured men?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus, the illusions some of us still held were destroyed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One by one, and then, quite unexpectedly, most of us were what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Overcome by a grim sense of humor?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What do we have to lose except our so ridiculously naked lives?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the showers started to run, we all tried very hard to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it okay to make fun, both about ourselves and about each other?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did all real water flow from the spraysl?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apart from that strange kind of humor, another sensation that I felt was a deep and profound sadness.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have experienced this kind of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Curiosity before, as a fundamental reaction toward certain?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By a climbing accident, did you feel only one sensation at the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Critical moment: should I be curious?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Come out of it alive or with a fractured skull or some other injury?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What motivated even the Auschwitz guards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How did detaching the mind from its surroundings come?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How can one be regarded with a kind of objectivity?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cultivated this state of mind as a means of protection?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were you anxious to know what would happen next?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would the consequence, for example, be of our standing in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The open air, in the chill of late autumn, stark naked, and what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the next few days, will our curiosity be aroused?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we not catch the Osity that evolved into surprise?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were many similar surprises in store for new arrivals?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 30 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The medical men among us learned first of all:?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Textbooks tell lies!\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somewhere it is said that man cannot what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can a person exist without sleep for more than a stated number of hours?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quite wrongly, had I been convinced that there were certain?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Things I just could not do: Could I sleep without this?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could you not live with that or the other?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did Auschwitz have beds that were constructed in tiers?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On each tier (measuring about six-and-a-half to eight feet), how many people can fit?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slept nine men, directly on the boards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We could, of course, lie only on what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which sides are crowded and huddled against each other?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had some advantages because of the bitter cold?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was it forbidden to take shoes up to the bunks for some people?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you use them secretly as pillows in spite of the fact that they?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Otherwise one's head had to rest on what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The crook of an almost dislocated arm?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And brought oblivion and relief from pain for a few hours?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How would you like me to mention a few similar surprises?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much could we endure: were we unable to clean our teeth?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet, in spite of that and a severe vitamin deficiency, what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we have healthier gums than ever before?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The same shirts for half a year, until they had lost all appeal?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For days we were unable to wash, what happened?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even partially, because of frozen water-pipes, and yet the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sores and abrasions on hands which were dirty from work in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the soil suppurate?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or for instance, a light sleeper, who used to be disoriented?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turbed by the slightest noise in the next room, now found?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Himself lying pressed against a comrade who snored loudly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few inches from his ear and yet slept quite soundly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If someone now asked us the truth of Dostoevski's work, what would we say?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is a man?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Used to anything, would we reply, \"yes, a man can get used?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"To anything, but do not ask us how.\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Investigations have not taken us that far yet; neither had they?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thought of suicide was entertained by nearly every what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One, if only for a brief time?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of the situation, is the constant danger of death looming over?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the closeness of the deaths suffered?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will be mentioned later, i made myself a firm promise, on?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My first evening in camp, would I not \"run into the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was a phrase used in camp to describe the most what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ting suicide, since, for the average inmate, life expectation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calculating objectively and counting all likely chances, what was the most probable outcome?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could he not with any assurance expect to be?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Among the small percentage of men who survived all the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The prisoner of auschwitz, in the first phase of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did shock not fear death?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Horrors for him after the first few daysâ€”after all, they?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spared him the act of committing suicide?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Friends whom i have met later have told me that i was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not one of those whom the shock of admission greatly de\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I only smiled, and quite sincerely, when the follow\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What episode occurred the morning after our first night in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In spite of strict orders not to leave our what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Blocks,\" a colleague of mine, who had arrived in Auschwitz?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Several weeks previously, did he smuggle himself into our hut?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He wanted to calm and comfort us and tell us a few things?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had become so thin that at first we did not recognize him.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a show of good humor and a devil-may-care attitude?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are the few hurried tips he gave us?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The SS medical chief has a soft?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the proper question?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who said, \"I think it was Lessing?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There are things which must cause you to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lose your reason or you have none to lose?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Psychiatrists expect the reactions of a man to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is an abnormal situation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mitted to an asylum, to be abnormal in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is 32 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Doctor of a block, of huts, and a man of some?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sixty years, told me how he had?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How many years ago did he tell you this?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To let off his son, who?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"But one thing I beg of you\"; he continued,?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Shave daily, if at all possible, even if you what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have to use a piece of glass to do what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you had to give your last piece of bread to someone, who would it be?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you want to stay alive, what is there?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is there only one way to look fit for work?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Limp, because, let us say, you have a small what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Blister on your heel, and an SS man spots?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will he wave you aside the next day?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are you sure to be gassed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What do we mean by a 'moslem'?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the author's tone in the sentence?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And who cannot manage hard physical labor?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is that a moslem?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Later, usually sooner, every 'moslem' goes to where?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shave, stand, and walk smartly; then you?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Need not be afraid of gas?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Standing here, even if you have only been what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Here, twenty-four hours, you need not fear?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Who must fear the next selection?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would anyone in my place on that day have?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What led the man to his admission to a concentration camp?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does \"Camp also represents an abnormal state of\" represent?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mind, but judged objectively it is a normal?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is mind, but judged objectively it a normal?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, as will be shown later, typical reaction?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As i have described them, began to change in what way?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First to the second phase; the phase of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What kind of apathy did he achieve?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Painful emotions, all of which he tried to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First of all, there was his boundless what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Longing for his home and his family?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Often could become so acute that he felt?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was disgust with all the ugliness?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which surrounded him, even in its mere?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most of the prisoners were given a uniform?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which of the rags would have made a scarecrow?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The camp lay pure filth, and the more one what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Worked to clear it away, the more one had to?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How do you practice detailing a new arrival to work?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the group's job that was responsible for cleaning the latrines?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did some of the excrement splash?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Into his face during its transport over bumpy?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fields, are you seeing any sign of disgust by the prisoner?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Any attempt to wipe off the filth would only make it worse.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Should you be punished with a blow from a capo?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus the mortification of normal reactions was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At first the prisoner looked away if he?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could not he bear to see fellow group members?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prisoners march up and down for hours in the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mire, their movements directed by blows?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Days or weeks later, things changed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the morning, when it was still dark, the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prisoner stood in front of the gate with his what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 34 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A comrade was knocked down and pulled to his feet again. What happened next?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And knocked down once moreâ€”why?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But had reported to sick-bay at an improper time?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Being punished for this irregular attempt to be relieved of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the prisoner who had passed into the second stage of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did his psychological reactions avert his eyes any more?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By then his feelings were blunted, and he watched uninterestedly as the drama unfolded before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What were his feelings by then?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another example: did he find himself waiting at sick?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bay, hoping to be granted two days of light work inside the house?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the camp due to injuries, edema, or fever?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did he stand unmoved while a twelve-year-old boy was carried in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who had been forced to stand at attention for hours in the sun?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which is better, snow or to work outside with bare feet?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is there no shoes for him in the camp?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bitten, and the doctor on duty picked off the black gan\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How do you remove grenous stumps with tweezers, one by one?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And pity are emotions that our spectator could not really feel?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sufferers, the dying and the dead, be what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Came such commonplace sights to him after a few weeks of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Camp life that they could not move him any more?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who ran the hut for typhus patients that I spent some time in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Very high temperatures and were often delirious, many of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After one of them had just died, did you watch?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without any emotional upset, which scene followed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was the sentence repeated over and over again with each death?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the prisoners approached the still warm body.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you grab the remains of a messy meal of potatoes, or another?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Decided that the corpse's wooden shoes were an improvement?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mentioned on his own, and exchanged them?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The same with the dead man's coat, and another was glad to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you secure some genuine string?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you watch all this with unconcern?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The \"nurse\" to remove the body.?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who is the \"nurse\" to remove the body?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When did he decide to do so?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He took the corpse by its legs, allowing it to drop into the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Small corridor between the two rows of boards which were what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What happened to the beds for the fifty typhus patients?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bumpy earthen floor toward the door?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which always constituted a prob?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lem for us, since we were exhausted from a chronic lack of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a few months' stay in the camp, could we not leave?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Walk up those steps, which were each about six inches high?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without putting our hands on the door jambs to pull our\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The man with the corpse approached the steps.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then the body: first the feet, then?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The trunk, and finallyâ€”with an uncanny rattling noiseâ€”what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the head of the corpse bump up the two steps?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My place was on the opposite side of the hut, next to the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Small, sole window, which was built near the floor?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My cold hands clasped a bowl of hot soup from which i?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sipped greedily, did you happen to look out the window?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which corpse stared in at me with just been removed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two hours before, had I spoken to that man?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, continued sipping my soup?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If my lack of emotion had not surprised me, from where would it have come?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Standpoint of professional interest, would you not remember?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This incident now, because there was so little feeling in\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feeling that what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One could not care any more, if the symptoms were arising?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" During the second stage of the prisoner's psychological re-education, what methods are used on the prisoners?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Actions, and which eventually made him insensitive to daily?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What were the actions that eventually made him insensitive to daily life?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By means of this insensibility, what is the pris?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oner soon surrounded himself with a very necessary protec\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 36 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did beatings occur on the slightest provocation, sometimes?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For example, bread was rationed out at what time?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we have to line up for our work site?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind me stood off a little to one side and that lack of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I did not know what was?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is going on in the line behind me, nor in the mind of the ss?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Guard, but suddenly I received two sharp blows on my head?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only then did I spot the guard at my side who was?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At such a moment, is it not the physical?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as well)?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much as to punished children); it is the mental agony?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What caused the injustice?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is there a word that describes a blow that does not find its target?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can Mark hurt more than one under certain circumstances?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once i was standing on a railway track?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was i once standing on a railway track?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In spite of the weather, did our party have to?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you work quite hard at mending the track?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With gravel, since that was the only way to keep warm?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only one moment did I pause to get my breath and to lean on?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then and thought i was loafing?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the speaker not from any insults or any blows?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do you think it is worth his while to say anything, not even a swear?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Word, to the ragged, emaciated figure standing before him?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which probably reminded him only vaguely of a human?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead, did he pick up a stone and throw it playfully?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That, to me, seemed the way to attract attention?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of a beast, to call a domestic animal back to its job, what is a?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Creature with which you have so little in common that you what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most painful part of beatings is the insult which?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At one time, did we have to carry some long, heavy?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If one man slipped, did he endanger?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not only himself but all the others who carried the same what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An old friend of mine had a congenitally dislocated joint.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was he glad to be capable of working in spite of it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since the physically disabled were almost certainly sent to where?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Death when a selection took place?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With an especially heavy girder, and seemed about to fall?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And drag the others with him?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As yet, was I not carrying a?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Girder so i jumped to his assistance without stopping to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was I immediately hit on the back, rudely reprimanded?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was I manded and ordered to return to my place?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Previously, the same guard who struck me had told us?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Deprecatingly that we \"pigs\" lacked the spirit of comrade?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another time, in a forest, with the temperature at 2Â°f, what happened?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Began to dig up the topsoil, which was frozen hard, in order to plant the tulip bulbs?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By then, had I grown rather weak physically?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Along came a foreman with chubby rosy cheeks.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Face definitely reminded me of a pig's head?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He wore lovely warm gloves in that bitter cold. Did he wear lovely warm gloves in that bitter cold?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt that trouble was brewing, for what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In front of me lay the mound of earth which showed exactly what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then he began: \"you pig, i have been watching you the?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Will you teach me how to work?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Dirt with your teethâ€”you'll die like an animal!?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Will you finish me off?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You've never done a stroke of work in your life?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But did I have to take his threat of killing?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Me seriously, so i straightened up and looked him directly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Were you a doctor--a specialist?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I bet you got a lot of money out of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"As it happens, did you do most of your work for no money?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the purpose of all clinics?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, now, had I said too much?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He threw himself on me and knocked me down, shouting \"What are you doing?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can no longer remember what he shouted?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I want to show with this apparently trivial story that what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 38 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There are moments when indignation can rouse even a?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the cruelty or pain about the insult connected with it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did that time blood rush to your head because you had to listen?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To a man who had so little idea of my life, how can he judge it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Must confess: the following remark, which i made to my?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fellow-prisoners after the scene, afforded me childish relief?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who looked so vulgar and brutal that the nurse in the out-?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would patient ward in my hospital have even admitted?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you take him to the waiting room?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fortunately, was the capo in my working party obligated?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To me, he had taken a liking to me because I listened to his?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which he poured out, love stories and matrimonial troubles?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" During the long marches, did we ever reach our work site?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is my impression on him with my diagnosis of his character?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ful, and this had already been of value to me?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Previous occasions he had reserved a place for me next to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which of the first five rows is he in in our detachment?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the regiment usually consist of two hundred and eighty men?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We had to line up early in the morning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you see the sunrise this morning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it late and do you have to stand in the back rows?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the senior required for an unpleasant and disliked job?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did Capo appear and usually collect the men he needed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What happened to these men?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the other, especially dreaded kind of work under the command?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the first five rows, just to catch those who tried to be what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are all protests and entreaties silenced by a few?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well-aimed kicks, and the chosen victims were chased to where?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The meeting place with shouts and blows?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However, as long as my capo felt the need of pouring out?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His heart, could this not happen to me?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where is the place of honor next to him?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like nearly all the camp inmates, was I suffering?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was wrong with my legs?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could you scarcely bend your knees?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my feet?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There would not have been space for socks?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even if I had had any?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So my partly bare feet were always what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the reason that your shoes are always full of snow?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clumps of ice formed on our shoes during our walk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clumps of ice formed on our shoes during our walk?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slipped and those following behind stumbled on top of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would the column stop for a moment, or not?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the guards soon took action and worked?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over the men with the butt of his rifle to make them get up?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The more to the front of the column you were, the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Less often you were disturbed by having to stop and then to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you make up for lost time by running on your painful feet?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who was the personally appointed physician to?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His honor the capo, and to march in the first row at an?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As an additional payment for my services, could I be sure?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That as long as soup was being dealt out at lunchtime at our school, we were all happy?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would he dip the ladle right when my turn came?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To the bottom of the vat and fish out a few peas?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A former army officer, even had the courage to whisper to whom?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The foreman, whom i had quarreled with, knew me?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To be an unusually good worker?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did that help matters?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he nevertheless managed to save my life (one of the)?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many times it was to be saved)?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the purpose of saving it many times?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the foreman smuggle you into another work?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were foremen who felt sorry for us and who did what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did they do their best to ease our situation, at least at the building site?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 40 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But even they kept on reminding us that an ordinary what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the laborer do several times as much work as we did, and in a day?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But did they see reason if they were told that?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A normal workman did not live on 10-1\/2 ounces of bread?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Theoretically, how much milk should we have had and how many pints of it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the average amount of soup a normal laborer eats in a day?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The mental stress we had to submit to, not having news of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who had either been sent to another camp or what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was a normal workman gassed right away?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ended by death continuously, daily, and hourly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could you low yourself to say once to a kindly foreman?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Learn from me how to do a brain operation in as short a time as possible?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Time as i am learning this road work from you, i would?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do you have great respect for me?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: pre\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Serving one's own life and that of the other fellow--is that proper?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it typical to hear the prisoners while they are being herded?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Back to camp from their work sites in the evening, do the miners sigh with relief?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the speaker's relief and saying at the end of the day?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can it be readily understood that such a state of strain?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Coupled with the constant necessity of concentrating on what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What forced the prisoner's inner life down?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who was trained in psychoanalysis often spoke of a?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Regression\" in the camp inmateâ€”a retreat to a more?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did the prisoner dream about most frequently?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are the four things listed in the sentence?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Having these simple desires satisfied led him to seek wish-fulfillment?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is another matter; the dreamer had to wake from them to?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The reality of camp life, and to the terrible contrast between what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I shall never forget how i was roused one night by the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are the groans of a fellow prisoner who threw himself about in his?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is sleep obviously having a horrible nightmare?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Always been especially sorry for people who suffered from what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fearful dreams or deliria, i wanted to wake the poor man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you want to wake the poor man?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Him, frightened at the thing i was about to do.?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was I about to do that scared him?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moment i became intensely conscious of the fact that no what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which we belonged?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Because of the high degree of undernourishment, what can be done to improve the food situation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The prisoners suffered, was it natural that they would desire food?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was the major primitive instinct around which mental life?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let us observe the majority of prisoners when?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did they happen to work near each other and were, for once?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One fellow would ask another working next to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What were his favorite dishes?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would you like to exchange recipes and plan the menu for the day?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When would they have a reunion--the day in a distant?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Future when they would be liberated and returned home?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suddenly a warning was passed down the trench, usually in what form?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The form of a special password or number: \"the guard is?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I always regarded the discussions about food as dangerous?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it not wrong to provoke the organism with such?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do detailed and affective pictures of delicacies have an impact?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somehow managed to adapt itself to extremely small?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Logical relief, is it an illusion which physiologically, surely?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" During the later part of our imprisonment, did the daily ration of food decrease?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What consisted of very watery soup given out once daily?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In addition to that, was there anything else?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the so-called \"extra allowance,\" consisting of?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the difference between an ounce of margarine and a slice of poor quality sausage?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What would you like in your tea, Sage, a little piece of cheese, or a bit of synthetic honey?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the jam like?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Diet was absolutely inadequate, especially taking into consideration what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Consider our heavy manual work and our constant exposure?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Does exposure to the cold in inadequate clothing cause problems?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were \"under special care\" those who were allowed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To lie in the huts instead of leaving the camp for workâ€”is that what you want to do?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When did the last layers of subcutaneous fat vanish?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And we looked like skeletons disguised with skin and rags?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could we watch our bodies beginning to devour themselves?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The organism digested its own protein, and the muscles?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then the body had no powers of resistance?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One after another, the members of the little community?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Each of us could calculate with fair ac\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whose turn would be next, and when would his own be?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After many observations, did we know the symptoms well?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which made the correctness of our prognoses quite certain?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"he won't last long,\" or, \"this is the next one,\" we whis\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are we searching for during our daily routine?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lice, did we see our own naked bodies in the evening?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thought alike: this body here, my body, is really a corpse?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am but a small portion?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the great mass of human flesh?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wire, crowded into a few earthen huts; a mass of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Daily, a certain portion begins to rot because it has become what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I mentioned above how unavoidable were the thoughts?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I mentioned above how unavoidable are the thoughts?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" About food and favorite dishes, which forced themselves into what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The consciousness of the prisoner, whenever he had a moment, was filled with wonder at his position."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the consciousness of the prisoner filled with, whenever he had a moment?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps it can be understood, then, that even what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The strongest of us was longing for the time when he would what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you been eating fairly good food again, not for the sake of good food?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the sake of knowing that the sub-human exists, itself, but?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What had made us unable to think of anything else?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would food at last cease?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who has not gone through a similar experience?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you hardly conceive of the soul-destroying mental conflict?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And clashes of will power which a famished man experiences?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can they hardly grasp what it means to stand dig?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ging in a trench, listening only for the siren to announce what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 9:30 or 10:00 a.m.â€”the half-hour lunch intervalâ€”when?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would bread be rationed out as long as it was still available?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Able); repeatedly asking the foremanâ€”if he wasn't a dis\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the time?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the meaning of \"Ing a piece of bread in one's coat pocket, first stroking it?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With frozen gloveless fingers, then breaking off a crumb, what does the speaker do?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Putting it in one's mouth and finally, with the last bit of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will power, pocketing it again, having promised oneself that?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it morning or afternoon?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could we hold endless debates on the sense or nonsense?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which of the following methods of dealing with the small bread ration is the most effective?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which was given out only once daily during the latter part?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were two schools of thought.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One was in favor of eating up the ration immediately?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had the twofold advantage of satisfying the worst hunger?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pangs for a very short time at least once a day and of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the ration being safeguarded against possible theft or loss?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second group, which held with dividing the ration up, used what?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" What are the six main categories of life?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Position in societyâ€”all these were things that could be what?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich starker.\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which does not kill me, makes me stronger?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then i spoke about the future?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did I say that to the impar?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Does the future seem hopeless?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could we guess for ourselves how small his chances were?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I told them that although there was still no typhus, what was the cause of the outbreak?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is 90 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Epidemic in the camp, i estimated my own chances at about 50\/50?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I also told them that, in spite of this, I?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you have any intention of losing hope and giving up?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Knew what the future would bring, much less the next?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even if we could not expect any sensational military news?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Events in the next few days, who knew better than we, with?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How great are the chances that our experience of camps will be positive?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Opened up, quite suddenly, at least for the individual?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instance, one might be attached unexpectedly to a special what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the group with exceptionally good working conditions?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was the kind of thing which constituted the \"luck\" of the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But did I not only talk of the future and the veil which?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I also mentioned the past; all its joys?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And how does its light shine even in the present darkness?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did I quote a poet to avoid sounding like a preacher myself?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who had written, \"was du erlebst, kann keine macht der?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What have you experienced, no power?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On earth can take from you?)\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What have all we done, whatever great thoughts we may have?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though it may seem like all we have suffered is for naught, is that really the case?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the past something we have brought into being?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the surest kind of being?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then I spoke of the many opportunities of giving life a try.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I told my comrades (who lay motionless, al\\xad?)\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though occasionally a sigh could be heard, could that human life be any good?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Under any circumstances, does it ever cease to have a meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And that this infinite meaning of life includes suffering and what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I asked the poor creatures, \"Who?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Listened to me attentively in the darkness of the hut to face what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Up to what seriousness is our position?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hope but should keep their courage in the certainty that the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the hopelessness of our struggle detract from its dignity?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I said that someone looks down on each of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is somebody alive or not a friend or wife in difficult hours?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dead, or a godâ€”would he not expect us to disappoint?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would he hope to find us suffering proudly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And finally, did I speak of our sacrifice, which had meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was in the nature of this sacrifice that it what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Should the sentence appear to be pointless in the normal world?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those of us who had any religious faith, is that a good thing?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Said frankly, could you understand without difficulty?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Them of a comrade who on his arrival in camp had tried to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Make a pact with heaven that his suffering and death will not be in vain?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Should he save the human being he loved from a painful end?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For this man, suffering and death were meaningful; his was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the deepest significance of the sacrifice?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the purpose of my words?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our life, then and there, in that hut and in that practically?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did I see that my efforts had been successful?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the electric bulb flared up again, did you see the miserable?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are figures of my friends limping toward me to thank me with?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But do you have to confess here that only too?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rarely had I the inner strength to make contact with my?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What companions in suffering have I missed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We now come to the third stage of a prisoner's mental?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reactions: the psychology of the prisoner after his liberation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But prior to that, shall we consider a question?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Psychologist is asked frequently, especially when he has per\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What can you tell us about Sonal's knowledge of these matters?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the psychological make-up of the camp guards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it possible that men of flesh and blood could treat others?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is 92 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As so many prisoners say they have been treated, what are the conditions like in the prison?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once you heard these accounts, did you come to believe them?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These things did happen, one is bound to ask how, psycho?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Out going into great detail, a few things must be pointed out?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First, among the guards there were some sadists, sadists in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, these sadists were always selected when a really tough job had to be done?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Severe detachment of guards was needed?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was great joy at our work site when we had per\\xad what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mission to warm ourselves for a few minutes (after two?)\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How many hours of work are there in the bitter frost in front of a little stove?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which was fed with twigs and scraps of wood?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do some foremen always find great pleasure in taking?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pleasure when they not only forbade us to stand there but what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turned over the stove and dumped its lovely fire into the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the ss took a dislike to a person, was there?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Always some special man in their ranks known to have a what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the passion for, and to be highly specialized in, sadistic torture?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To whom was the unfortunate prisoner sent?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, the feelings of the majority of the guards had what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you been dulled by the number of years in which, in ever-?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Increasing doses, had they witnessed the brutal methods of?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These morally and mentally hardened men, at what point did they become that way?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did Least refuse to take active part in sadistic measures?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did they prevent others from carrying them out?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fourth, it must be stated that even among the guards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were some who took pity on us?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The commander of the camp from which i was liberated?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who was found after the liberationâ€”only the camp doctor?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prisoner himself, had known of it previouslyâ€”that this man?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you order to purchase medicines for his prisoners from the nearest store?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is the market town the senior camp warden, a prisoner?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was himself harder than any of the ss guards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Other prisoners at every slightest opportunity, while the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Camp commander, to my knowledge, never once lifted his what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is apparent that the mere knowledge that a man was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us almost nothing?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which as a whole it would be easy to condemn?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Boundaries between groups overlapped and we must not try what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To simplify matters, did you say that these men were angels?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Achievement for a guard or foreman to be kind to the prisoners?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oners in spite of all the camp's influences, and, on the other?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hand, the baseness of a prisoner who treated his own com\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The prisoners found the lack of character in such men especially distressing.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cially upsetting, while they were profoundly moved by the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the smallest kindness received from any of the guards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Member how one day a foreman secretly gave me a piece of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bread which i knew he must have saved from his breakfast?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was far more than the small piece of bread which?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1. An interesting incident with reference to this SS commander is in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the attitude toward him of some of his jewish prisoners?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The end of the war when the American troops liberated the prisoners?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From our camp, three young hungarian jews hid this commander in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then they went to the commandant of the ameri\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can forces who were very eager to capture this ss commander and they?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Said they would tell him where he was but only under certain conditions?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tions: the American commander must promise that absolutely no harm will come to the hostages?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a while, the American officer finally what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Promised these young jews that the ss commander when taken into custody would be tried as a war criminal?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would captivity be kept safe from harm?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the officer keep his promise?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who was the Mander of this concentration camp?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Did that event move you to tears at the time?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did this man give to me, the word and look?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From all this we may learn that there are two races of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Men in this world, but only these twoâ€”the \"race\" of the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the difference between a decent man and an indecent man?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Does no group consist entirely of decent or indecent people?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This sense, no group is of \"pure race\"â€”and therefore one?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Occasionally, did you find a decent fellow among the camp guards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Life in a concentration camp tore open the human soul?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it surprising that in those depths?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We again found only human qualities which in their very what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is nature a mixture of good and evil?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good from evil, which goes through all human beings,?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the con\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And now to the last chapter in the psychology of a con?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the psychology of the prisoner who has been in a concentration camp?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In describing the experiences of liberation, what does the author say?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which naturally must be personal, shall we pick up the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Threads of that part of our narrative which told of the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What happened in the morning when the white flag was hoisted above the camp?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gates after days of high tension?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it wrong to think that we went mad with joy?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With tired steps, did we prisoners drag ourselves to the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Timidly we looked around and glanced at each other?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then we ventured a few steps out of what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time no orders were shouted at us, nor was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is there any need to duck quickly to avoid a blow or kick?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time the guards offered us cigarettes, we hardly what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Recognized them at first; had they hurriedly changed into?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We walked slowly along the road leading where?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soon our legs hurt and threatened to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But we limped on; did we want to see the camp's?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are the surroundings like for the first time with the eyes of free men?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \"Freedom\"â€”we repeated to ourselves, and yet we could not?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had we said this word so often during all the years?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we dream about it, that it had lost its meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did not penetrate into our consciousness; could we not?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Grasp the fact that freedom was ours?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We came to meadows full of flowers.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That they were there, but we had no feelings about them?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first spark of joy came when we saw a rooster with a what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But it remained only a spark;?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we not yet belong to this world?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the evening when we all met again in our hut, one what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Said secretly to the other, \"Tell me, were you pleased?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the other replied, feeling ashamed as he did not?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we all feel similarly, \"truthfully, no\" we had?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you literally lose the ability to feel pleased and have to relearn it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Psychologically, what was happening to the liberated?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can prisoners be called \"depersonalization?\"\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Appeared unreal, unlikely, as in a dream.?'\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How often in the past year have we been?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Deceived by dreams, did we dream that the day of liberation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had come, that we had been set free, had returned home?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Greeted our friends, embraced our wives, sat down at the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Greeted our friends, embraced our wives, sat down at the table?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the table start to tell of all the things we had gone?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throughâ€”even of how we had often seen the day of libera\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is 96 man's search for meaning?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ears, the signal to get up, and our dreams of freedom came?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And now the dream had come true?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Does the body have fewer inhibitions than the mind?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it a good use of the new freedom from the first moment on?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Began to eat ravenously, for hours and days, even half the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it amazing what quantities one can eat?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the prisoners was invited out by a friendly farmer?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the neighborhood, did he eat and eat and then drink coffee?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which loosened his tongue, and he then began to talk, often?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The pressure which had been on his mind for what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hearing him talk, one got the impression that he was very intelligent.\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Impression that he had to talk, that his desire to speak was what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have known people who have been under heavy?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is the proper question for the following sentence: Pressure only for a short time (for example, through a cross-?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What caused Examination by the gestapo to have similar reactions?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many days passed, until not only the tongue was loosened?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But something within oneself as well; then feeling suddenly?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What broke through the strange fetters which had restrained it?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One day, a few days after the liberation, did you walk?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What lies through the country past flowering meadows for miles and?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Miles, toward the market town near the camp?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" One to be seen for miles around; there was nothing but the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does the sentence describe?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I stopped, looked around, and up to the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Skyâ€”and then i went down on my knees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you go down on your knees?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was very little I knew of myself or of the worldâ€”I had what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I called to what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How long did I kneel there and repeat this sentence to myself?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I know that on that day, in?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did your new life start that hour?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until I again became a human being?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The way that led from the acute mental tension of the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What were the last days in camp like?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was certainly not free from obstacles?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To think that a liberated prisoner was not in need of spirit?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We have to consider that a man who what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Has such mental pressure been enormous for such a long time?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is Long time naturally in some danger after his liberation?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Especially since the pressure was released quite suddenly, don't you think?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This danger (in the sense of psychological hygiene) is the?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would the health of the caisson worker be endangered if he left?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His diver's chamber suddenly (where he is under enormous pressure?)\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Would you forbid me to tread on a few stalks of oats!\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only slowly could these men be guided back to the com\\xad?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is it not a monplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even if wrong has been done to them, will they still help others?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lead them back to this truth, or the consequences would what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could the situation have been much worse than the loss of a few thousand stalks?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you still see the prisoner who rolled up his shirt?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sleeves, thrust his right hand under my nose and shouted, \"What's this?\"\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" I want to emphasize that the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was the man who said these words a bad fellow?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you and your friend been the best of comrades in camp and afterwards?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apart from the moral deformity resulting from the sudden increase in the number of divorces, what other negative effects does this have on society?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What are the two other things?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fundamental experiences which threatened to damage the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Character of the liberated prisoner: bitterness and disillu\\xad?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Did we say that he had to be shown something?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does the future hold?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Does that life still wait for him, does a human being still wait for him?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Found that no one awaited them?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Woe to him who, when the what?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the day of his dreams finally come, and did he find it so different from all?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps he boarded a trolley and traveled?\","}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And only in his mind, and pressed the bell, just as he has?\","}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Longed to do in thousands of dreams, only to find that the what?\","}
